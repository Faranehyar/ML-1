📘 Machine Learning Tutorial – Part 1

This repository contains Part 1 of a 3-part series on learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

🧠 About the Series

The goal of this tutorial series is to introduce the core concepts of machine learning in a structured and hands-on manner. Each part builds upon the previous one, progressing from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

📁 What’s Included in Part 1

In this notebook (ML-1.ipynb), you’ll learn:
 • What Machine Learning is and where it’s used
 • Setting up your environment (e.g., installing scikit-learn)
 • An overview of datasets and how to work with them
 • Introduction to supervised learning
 • Using essential Python libraries for ML:
 • scikit-learn
 • numpy
 • scipy
 • joblib
 • threadpoolctl

🛠 Requirements

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed. You can do so using:

pip uninstall scikit-learn

pip install scikit-learn==1.2.0

This version is used to ensure compatibility with the code in this notebook.

📄 File Included
 • ML-1.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook for Part 1

🚀 What’s Next?

This is the first step in the journey. Stay tuned for:
 • Part 2: Intermediate ML concepts and model evaluation
 • Part 3: Advanced techniques and real-world applications
